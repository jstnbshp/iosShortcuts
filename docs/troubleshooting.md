# ðŸš‘ Troubleshooting

Having issues? Here are a few quick things to check:

1. **Credentials** â€” make sure your API keys and tokens are correct in the Shortcut.
2. **Network Access** â€” the Shortcut needs internet to reach OpenAI and Notion.
3. **Database Schema** â€” confirm your Notion database has the right properties: `Title`, `Transcription`, `Summary`, `Date`.

If all else fails, try deleting and re-importing the Shortcut.
